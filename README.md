# E-Commerce Online market

E-Commerce websites are online portals that facilitate online transactions of goods and services through means of the transfer of information and funds over the Internet.

I build my Online market using ASP .NET MVC C# as back-end. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax as front-end. And, using PostgresSQL as data base.

User can go choose the product they want and add to the cart, if you want to remove the item, just click the x symbol in your cart. User doesn't have to login or register to buy product.But the cart of each individual user on each device is complete than other people, they will not have a random product of some one else in their cart. Because they don't have to login but still using individual account to separate they cart to other user. 

Last but not least, user can purchase the product simply by click on process to check out in the cart. I use Stripe API to handle the payment, and customer credit card to 100% safe by using Stripe API.
